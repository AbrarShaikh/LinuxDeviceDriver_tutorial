# Memory Management
- handles or manages primary memory. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location either it is allocated to some process or it is free. 
- It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. 
- It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.

## Logical and Physical Address Space
- An address generated by the CPU is a logical address. Logical address is also known a Virtual address.
- Address actually available on memory unit is a physical address. 
- Virtual and physical addresses are the same in compile-time and load-time address-binding schemes. 
- Virtual and physical addresses differ in execution-time address-binding scheme.
